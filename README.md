# tictactoe-game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe app created with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and JSX. When you load the game, Player X has the opportunity to go first, then Player O, then back to Player X and so on and so forth until we have a winner. Once a winner is declared, this will show on screen. In future updates to this app, I would like to add animations and transitions to give a more modern look and feel to the site.
